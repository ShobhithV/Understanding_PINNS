    "### The 1D Heat Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1D heat equation models how heat diffuses through a solid object (in this case, a rod) over time. It is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how the temperature, `u(x, t)`, changes with respect to both space (`x`) and time (`t`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\$frac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}$\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( u(x, t) \\) is the temperature at position `x` and time `t`.\n",
    "- \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant of the material (how quickly heat diffuses through the material).\n",
    "- \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\) represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time.\n",
    "- \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\) represents the spatial second derivative of the temperature (essentially, the curvature of the temperature profile), which models how temperature changes at a point relative to its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Solution Using Finite Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1D heat equation is often solved numerically using a method called **finite differences**. The domain is discretized into a grid, with both space and time split into small steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial grid (`x`)**: The rod is divided into `n` points along its length, each separated by a distance `dx`.\n",
    "- **Time grid (`t`)**: The simulation is run over `m` time steps, with each step being of size `dt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical approximation to the heat equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "u(t+1, x) = u(t, x) + \\frac{k \\cdot dt}{dx^2} \\left( u(t, x+1) - 2u(t, x) + u(t, x-1) \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( u(t, x) \\) is the temperature at position `x` and time `t`.\n",
    "- The term \\( \\frac{k \\cdot dt}{dx^2} \\) is the diffusion coefficient, which controls how heat spreads over time.\n",
    "- The term \\( (u(t, x+1) - 2u(t, x) + u(t, x-1)) \\) is the second spatial derivative, approximating how the temperature at a point is affected by the temperature at neighboring points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Finite Difference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Forward Difference (Explicit Method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used in the provided code is called the **Forward Difference Method** or **Explicit Method**. In this method, the future temperature at a point is calculated using information from the current time step. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "u(t+1, x) = u(t, x) + \\frac{k \\cdot dt}{dx^2} \\left( u(t, x+1) - 2u(t, x) + u(t, x-1) \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple to implement and computationally cheap.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Requires small time step sizes (`dt`) for stability (i.e., the solution can become unstable if `dt` is too large).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Backward Difference (Implicit Method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Backward Difference Method** or **Implicit Method** is a more stable but computationally more expensive approach. In this method, the future temperature is calculated using information from the next time step, which requires solving a system of equations at each time step. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "u(t+1, x) = u(t, x) + \\frac{k \\cdot dt}{dx^2} \\left( u(t+1, x+1) - 2u(t+1, x) + u(t+1, x-1) \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros**: More stable than the Forward Difference method, especially for larger time step sizes (`dt`).\n",
    "- **Cons**: Requires solving a system of equations at each time step, making it computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system of equations for this method can be solved iteratively or using matrix methods, leading to a tridiagonal system that can be solved efficiently using methods like **Thomas Algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Crank-Nicolson Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Crank-Nicolson Method** is a combination of the Forward and Backward Difference methods. It is a **semi-implicit method** that takes an average of the current and next time step values for the spatial derivatives. This method is unconditionally stable and typically gives more accurate results than either of the two methods on its own. The formula for the Crank-Nicolson method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "u(t+1, x) = u(t, x) + \\frac{k \\cdot dt}{2dx^2} \\left( u(t+1, x+1) - 2u(t+1, x) + u(t+1, x-1) + u(t, x+1) - 2u(t, x) + u(t, x-1) \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros**: Stable and accurate, works well for larger time steps and gives better results for diffusive problems.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Requires solving a system of equations at each time step, making it computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial and Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Condition**: At time \\( t = 0 \\), the temperature distribution is initialized (in your code, it's set to zero initially).\n",
    "- **Boundary Conditions**: The temperature at the left and right boundaries (x=0 and x=length) is held fixed throughout the simulation (`temp_left` and `temp_right`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This code simulates how the temperature changes along a 1D rod over time, given specific boundary and initial conditions. The result is a series of plots showing how the temperature profile evolves as heat diffuses through the rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward Difference**: Simple to implement and fast, but less stable for larger time steps.\n",
    "- **Backward Difference**: More stable, especially for larger time steps, but computationally more expensive due to the need to solve a system of equations.\n",
    "- **Crank-Nicolson**: Best of both worlds, stable and accurate, but more computationally intensive due to the need to solve a system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its strengths and is used depending on the specific requirements of the problem (e.g., accuracy vs. computation time).\n"
